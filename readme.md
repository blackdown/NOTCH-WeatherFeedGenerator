## Command Line Options

The NOTCH Data Tool can be run from the command line with the following options:

### Executable (Windows)

```bash
# Basic usage with settings from config.ini
NOTCH-Data-Tool.exe

# Run in command-line mode with options
NOTCH-Data-Tool.exe --city="Paris" --interval=5
```

### Python Script

```bash
# Basic usage with settings from config.ini
python notch_data_tool.py

# Specify city and update interval
python notch_data_tool.py --city="Berlin" --interval=10
```

#### Available Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--city` | City to fetch weather for | Value from config.ini (or "London") |
| `--interval` | Update interval in minutes (1-60) | Value from config.ini (or 2 minutes) |

## Files

- `notch_data_tool.py` - Main application entry point
- `modules/weather_tab.py` - Weather monitoring module
- `modules/midi_tab.py` - MIDI control interface module
- `modules/settings_tab.py` - Application settings module
- `modules/app.py` - Core application framework
- `modules/midi.py` - MIDI helper functions
- `modules/config.py` - Configuration management
- `build.py` - Script to build executable
- `weather.csv` - CSV file containing weather data history
- `config.ini` - Created on first run to store settings

## Setup and Running

### Using Python (Development)

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackdown/NOTCH-Data-Tool.git
cd NOTCH-Data-Tool
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests python-rtmidi
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python notch_data_tool.py
```

### Creating an Executable (Distribution)

1. Run the build script to create a standalone executable:
```bash
python build.py
```

2. Find the executable in the `dist` folder and run it.

## First Run

1. When you first run the application, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenWeatherMap API key
2. If you don't have an API key, you can get one for free at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
3. The app will securely store your API key and selected city for future use
4. You'll need to select a MIDI output device to send MIDI messages

## Configuration

Your settings are securely stored in a `config.ini` file and include:
- API key (stored with basic encryption)
- City preference
- Update interval (in minutes)
- Last used MIDI device

You can change these settings any time through the application interface:
- Use the Settings tab to update weather and API settings
- Use the MIDI tab to configure MIDI output devices and message parameters

## Weather Data

The application retrieves and displays the following weather information:
- Current temperature (Â°C)
- Weather description
- Wind speed (m/s) and direction (degrees)
- Humidity, pressure, and "feels like" temperature

All data is stored chronologically in the CSV file, allowing you to track weather changes over time.
